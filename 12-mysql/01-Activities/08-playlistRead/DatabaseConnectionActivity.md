### 3. Students Do: Creating a Database Connection (10 ~ 15 mins)

* More time than necessary has been provided to this particular assignment to ensure that everyone creates a connection to MySQL through Node and is given ample time to create and populate a table.

* Students will be creating their own database of playlists. The instructor will be working with a database that is different but with the same number of rows in each table to help mirror as students create  and work with their own data.

* **Instructions**

  * Throughout this class we are going to be working on creating an application that takes in music data to create personalized playlists

    * Make sure to get as far as you can over the course of these assignments as the coding you do here will be extremely useful to you when you begin working on the homework

  * For now we will simply be creating your database in MySQL and then creating a connection to said database using Node. **Remember, you must create a database before attempting to connect to it. Doing otherwise will return an error.**

  * BONUS: Using MySQL Workbench, create a table in your database with four columns...

    * Primary Key of "ID" which auto-increments
    * A column called "title"
    * A column called "artist"
    * A column called "genre"

  * BONUS: Using MySQL Workbench, populate your table with a few rows of dummy data

  * BONUS: Start looking into how you can use the MySQL package to read data from a MySQL database
