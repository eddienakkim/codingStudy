### 11 Students Do: Contribute to Private Class Repository [04-HTML_Git, from earlier](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/tree/master/01-Class-Content/01-html-git-css/01-Activities/04-HTML_Git)(30 mins)

* Navigate to the Private Class Repository on GitLab and "Fork" it.
* When you "fork" a repository, you make a private copy of it in your own GitHub/GitLab account, depending on which site you fork it from.
* In the upper-right, find the option to "FORK" the repository.
* Select yourself/your profile as the "namespace"
* You should see a message indicating a "successful fork"
* If you navigate to your owned projects/repositories, you should see a copy of the class repository there.

* Clone this newly forked copy from your personal GitLab account projects onto your local machine.
* The process of cloning your repository from GitLab (or GitHub) was described earlier today, review the previous activity if you need a reminder
* Enter the 01-Week folder, which is the folder for all files associated with this week's lecture.
* Create a new folder with your correct first and last names (as we know it, in our gradebook), in the format of firstname-lastname
* Enter the firstname-lastname folder you just created.
* Copy the project contents from your [04-HTML_Git Activity](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/tree/master/01-Class-Content/01-html-git-css/01-Activities/04-HTML_Git), that you made earlier, into the firstname-lastname folder in the "Class's Private Repository" that you've just cloned to your local machine, and modified.

* You've now changed the "file-system" on the "Class's Private Repository". MAKE SURE TO ADD, COMMIT, AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES.
* These changes are only reflected on your personal GitLab repository! (Assuming you completed the previous step).
* In order for these changes to appear on the Class's Private Repository, you'll need  to visit the original repository's page and submit a "merge request" (called a pull request on GitHub).

* Submit a "merge request".
* Navigate to the Class's Private Repository's original location on GitLab (not your personal copy repository)
* On the very upper-right part of the web page, near the search bar, and your profile icon, there is another button for "merge request".

* Click on the "merge request" button to start the process of requesting the maintainer of the project to merge your code into the code base.
* Click on the big green button with the text "New merge request in UCLA-VIRT-FSF-PT-03-2020-U-LOL" in it, to create a new request.
* Set the source branch to "your copy of the repository"/"master"
* Set the target branch to "UCLA-Coding-Boot-Camp/ucla-virt-fsf-pt-03-2020-u-lol"/"master" (in this case, you'll be requesting me to merge your code into my "master" branch, from your "master" branch).
