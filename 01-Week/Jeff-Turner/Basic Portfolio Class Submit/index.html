    <p>My Name is Jeff Turner. I grew up in Southern California but currenlty reside in Minneapolis, MN. I work as a System Administrator for CBS Television where I oversee various networking and procution systems. </p>
   

    <p>I attended Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, CA where I graduated with a certificate in Audio Engineering. This opened doors to various live sound production oportunutes that enevitably led to my current career in IT. I also attended Bemidji State University for my Bachelors in Technology Management.</p>
    

    <p>As both an aspiring developer and entrepruener I hope to one day create a proprietary IT project management software for Media Production Outlets.</p>
